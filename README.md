# CppND-Capstone-Project

The &lt;Insert Project Name&gt; is the project for the Capstone Project in the Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program. <br />

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. FILL IN DESCRIPTION HERE.<br /><br />

## Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.11.3

* make >= 4.1 (Linux and Mac), 3.81 (Windows)

* gcc/g++ >= 5.4

## Building: Compile and Run

### Compilation

1. Create a `build` directory and enter it: `mkdir build && cd build`
2. Compile the code by using cmake and make with the following line:
```
cmake .. && make
```
### Execution

The executable is called `Capstone` and is placed in the `build` directory. This project must be run only within the `build` directory itself. Within this directory, run the project with the following command:

```
./Capstone
```

### Rubric Points

* README
	* A README with instructions is included with the project.
		* The README is included with the project and has instructions for building/running the project. <strong>File: README.md. Line Numbers: 15 - 30.</strong>
		* If any additional libraries are needed to run the project, these are indicated with cross-platform installation instructions. <strong>File: README.md. Line Numbers: 7-14.</strong>

		* You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf. <strong>File: README.md</strong>
	
* Compiling and Testing
	* The submission must compile and run.
		* See instructions above.

* Loops, Functions, I/O
	* The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structure.
		* A variety of control structures are used in the project. <strong>File: &lt;filename&gt;. Line numbers: &lt;line numbers&gt;.</strong>
		* The project is clearly organized into functions. <strong>File: &lt;filename&gt;. Line numbers: &lt;line numbers&gt;.</strong>

	* The project reads data from a file and processes the data, or the program writes data to a file.
		* The project reads data from an external file or writes data to a file as part of the necessary operation of the program. <strong>File: &lt;filename&gt;. Line numbers: &lt;line numbers&gt;.</strong>
	
	* The project accepts user input and processes the input.
		* The project accepts input from a user as part of the necessary operation of the program. <strong>File: &lt;filename&gt;. Line numbers: &lt;line numbers&gt;.</strong>

* Object-Oriented Programming
	* The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques.
		* The project code is organized into classes with class attributes to hold the data, and class methods to perform tasks. <strong>File: &lt;filename&gt;. Line numbers: &lt;line numbers&gt;.</strong>
	* Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members.
		* All class data members are explicitly specified as `public`, `protected`, or `private`. <strong>File: &lt;filename&gt;. Line numbers: &lt;line numbers&gt;.</strong>
	* Class constructors utilize member initialization lists.
		* All class members that are set to argument values are initialized through member initialization lists. <strong>File: &lt;filename&gt;. Line numbers: &lt;line numbers&gt;.</strong>
	* Classes abstract implementation details from their interfaces.
		* All class member functions document their effects, either through function names, comments, or formal documentation. Member functions do not change program state in undocumented ways. <strong>File: &lt;filename&gt;. Line numbers: &lt;line numbers&gt;.</strong>
	* Classes encapsulate behavior.
		* Appropriate data and functions are grouped into classes. Member data that is subject to an invariant is hidden from the user. State is accessed via member functions. <strong>File: &lt;filename&gt;. Line numbers: &lt;line numbers&gt;.</strong>
	* Classes follow an appropriate inheritance hierarchy.
		* Inheritance hierarchies are logical. Composition is used instead of inheritance when appropriate. Abstract classes are composed of pure virtual functions. Override functions are specified. <strong>File: &lt;filename&gt;. Line numbers: &lt;line numbers&gt;.</strong>
	* Overloaded functions allow the same function to operate on different parameters.
		* One function is overloaded with different signatures for the same function name. <strong>File: &lt;filename&gt;. Line numbers: &lt;line numbers&gt;.</strong>
	* Derived class functions override virtual base class functions.
		* One member function in an inherited class overrides a virtual base class member function. <strong>File: &lt;filename&gt;. Line numbers: &lt;line numbers&gt;.</strong>
	* Templates generalize functions in the project.
		*One function is declared with a template that allows it to accept a generic parameter. <strong>File: &lt;filename&gt;. Line numbers: &lt;line numbers&gt;.</strong>
